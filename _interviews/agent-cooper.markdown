- question: What was your reaction when your tweet went viral?
  answer_text: I was really surprised when so many retweeted my tweet 1,000 times

    I've met some amazing people out of sharing my feelings with the Twitter sphere.
- question: How did you muster up the courage to tell so many people?

    your journey?
