about_text: This project is the brain child of Liss Lafluer, a new media arts professor
  at the University of North Texas. The process consisted of going through metoo tweets
  that were very low level, and some of the most vulnerable. Her students and her
  created the glass shards in Maya. Then the maya data is parsed through javascript
  to make 3d enviornments with audio and animation to represent the tone and vulnerability
  of the tweets, and the authors of the tweets.
