about_text: "*Coded Glass* explores the urgency of the #metoo movement, the role of
  social technology, and the ways in which individual narratives can shape the web
  as a form of community building through the metaphor of glass, a rich art historical
  material. \n\nUsing collected data and analysis of 2,629,581 #metoo tweets from
  October 1, 2017 to August 15, 2018 as source material, this project showcases virtual
  stained glass windows of protest signs, emojis, and hashtags from the #metoo movement
  as a form of data visualization and metaphor for creating communal sacred spaces.
  This project is funded by an [Immersive Scholar](https://www.immersivescholar.org/)
  residency at the [NCSU Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/), and the Andrew W.
  Mellon Foundation.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/290814465\" width=\"640\"
