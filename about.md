about_text: "*Coded Glass* explores the urgency of the #metoo movement, the role of
  social technology, and the ways in which individual narratives can shape the web
  as a form of community building through the metaphor of glass, a rich art historical
  material. \n\nUsing the collected data and analysis of 2,629,581 English-lamguage
  #metoo tweets as source material, this project uses stained glass imagery as both
  a form for data visualization and a metaphor for creating communal sacred space.
  This project is funded by an Immersive Scholar Residency at the Hunt Library, and
  the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation."
