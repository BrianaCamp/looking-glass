about_text: "*Coded Glass* explores the urgency of the #metoo movement, the role of
  social technology, and the ways in which individual narratives can shape the web
  as a form of community building through the metaphor of glass, a rich art historical
  material. \n\nUsing the collected data and analysis of 2,629,581 #metoo tweets as
  source material, this project uses stained glass imagery as both a form of data
  visualization and a metaphor for creating communal sacred space. This project is
  funded by an [Immersive Scholar](https://www.immersivescholar.org/) residency at
  the [NCSU Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/), and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation."
