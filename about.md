about_text: "*Coded Glass* explores the urgency of the #MeToo movement, the role of
  social technology, and the ways in which individual narratives can shape the web
  as a form of community building through the metaphor of glass, a rich art historical
  material. This project is funded by an Immersive Scholar Residency at the Hunt Library,
  and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.  \n\nThis initiative investigates #MeToo data
  using a mix of theoretical, artistic, and quantitative methods:\n\n* We share our
  data about the demographics of people using #MeToo, their sentiments and common
  themes across the world. (#MeToo/ #BalanceTonPorc / #YoTambien/ #QuellaVoltaChe/
  ‏وانا_ايضا#)\n* Rich media visualizations as windows that assemble thousands of
  data points to reveal interesting patterns.\n* Shards that allow you to navigate
  the whole set of data as subsets of individual narratives.\n* A collection of interviews
  based on influential to discuss women in technology, intersectional feminism, and
  #metoo in contemporary culture.\n\n*The title for this work refers to:*\n\nCoded:
  \ a play on words for coating (traditionally applied to glass), coding (creative
  computer programming), and morse code (secret emergency signals)\n\nGlass: a space
  to share narratives and reflect (traditional stained glass), and a two-way mirror
  (social media and the glass of our digital devices)"
