about_text: "*> “Me Too is a movement to, among other things, radicalize the notion
  of mass healing. As a community we create a lot of space for fighting and pushing
  back but not enough for connecting and healing.” \n- Tarana Burke, founder of #metoo*\n\n**Coded
  Glass **## explores the urgency of the #metoo movement, the role of social technology,
  and the ways in which individual narratives can shape the web as a form of community
  building through the metaphor of glass, a rich art historical material. Using the
  collected data and analysis of 2,629,581 #metoo tweets as source material, this
  project uses stained glass imagery as both a form for data visualization and a metaphor
  for creating communal sacred space. This project is funded by an Immersive Scholar
  Residency at the Hunt Library, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n"
