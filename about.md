about_text: This project is the brain child of Liss Lafluer, a new media arts professor at the University of North Texas. The process consisted of going through metoo tweets that were very low level, and some of the most vulnerable. Her students and her created the glass shards in Maya. Then the maya data is parsed through javascript to make 3d enviornments with audio and animation to represent the tone and vulnerability of the tweets, and the authors of the tweets.
